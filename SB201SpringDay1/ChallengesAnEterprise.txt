- What are the challenges of developing an Enterprise application ?


1 Changing Business Requirements and Environments

The landscape of a business might change, sometimes completely.

 There can be technological transformation taking place. Or there can be economic disruptions.

2 Shifting to the mobile platform


Mobility and cloud-computing accelerate faster than the desktop counterparts,

and your company might lose relevance if you aren’t going mobile with your applications.


3 Security

A strong defense system is a primary requirement that includes encryptions and firewalls at application,

host and network level.

Enterprise Data is of utmost importance to a company. Use a competent security software to install and maintain security.

Make sure the privacy of sensitive user information is protected.

4 Big Data

The process of making sense of Big Data starts by correctly locating and rationalizing this data from 

various sub-systems of Enterprise Application.

It’s essential to narrow down the sources of data that can otherwise create a lot of repetitiveness.

5 Changing Technology

An Enterprise Application particularly can greatly benefit from Artificial Intelligence due to

data-driven tasks used in an Enterprise Application.

7 User Interface and Experience

The importance of beautifully designed, comfortable user-interface should not be underestimated as 

it can result in greater and impactful engagement, 

ultimately extracting more value from the same software.

8 Low ROI

The aim of an Enterprise Application can be to improve the sales cycle, 

increase the productivity of the employees or to smoothen and optimize internal processes.

The goal should be clear and it should be reflected in the design and development of the Enterprise Application.
