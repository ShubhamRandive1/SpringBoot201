What is Life Cycle of a Bean?

A Spring bean needs to be instantiated when the container starts, 

based on Java or XML bean definition. The framework may also be required to perform some pre and post-initialization steps to get the bean into a usable state.

After that, when the bean is no longer required, 

it will be removed from the IoC container. Like the initialization phase, 

the Spring framework may need to perform pre-and post-destruction steps to free the other system resources.


Life Cycle Callback Methods

Spring bean factory controls the creation and destruction of beans. 

To execute some custom code, the bean factory provides the callback methods, which can be categorized broadly into two groups:

Post-initialization callback methods

Pre-destruction callback methods
