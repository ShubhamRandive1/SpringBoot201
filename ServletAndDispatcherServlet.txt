Q1/- What is a Servlet ? What is the role of the DispatcherServlet in the Spring boot rest
application.


Servlets are the Java programs that run on the Java-enabled web server or application server. 

They are used to handle the request obtained from the webserver, process the request, produce the response, then send a response back to the webserver. 

Properties of Servlets are as follows:

Servlets work on the server-side.

Servlets are capable of handling complex requests obtained from the webserver.


DispatcherServlet acts as front controller for Spring based web applications. 

It provides a mechanism for request processing where actual work is performed by configurable, 

delegate components. It is inherited from javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet, it is typically configured in the web.xml file.

A web application can define any number of DispatcherServlet instances. 

Each servlet will operate in its own namespace, loading its own application context with mappings, handlers, etc. 

Only the root application context as loaded by ContextLoaderListener, if any, will be shared. In most cases, 

applications have only single DispatcherServlet with the context-root URL(/), that is, all requests coming to that domain will be handled by it.

DispatcherServlet uses Spring configuration classes to discover the delegate components it needs for request mapping, view resolution, exception handling etc.
