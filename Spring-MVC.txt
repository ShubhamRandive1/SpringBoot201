Spring Boot

In Spring Boot, the intuition is to avoid boilerplate code. 
All the dependencies are wrapped in a single unit, 
and one need not focus on dependency while delivering the product.

Spring MVC

One canâ€™t take advantage of the boilerplate concept, 

and every dependency needs to be specified separately in order for the product or feature to run.

Spring Boot

In the case of packaging in the form of JAR, 

one can include the embedded server in order for the feature to run stand-alone.

Spring MVC

A lot of manual configuration goes into the feature to attain the same level of packaging.

Spring Boot

The level of productivity will increase as not much time is spent in determining the dependencies and their versions.

Spring MVC


The level of productivity would decrease as a considerable amount of time is invested in understanding the dependency addition.

Spring Boot has other technologies one can use to build different other applications.
