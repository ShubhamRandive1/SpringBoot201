Q1/- What are the limitations of EntityManager methods to perform CRUD operations with
DB?
Q2/- Consider the following database schema:
Database name: db1
Table: employee
empId: int primary key
name: varchar not null
address: varchar not null
salary: int not null
Implement the following EmployeeDao interface using JPA with hibernate:-
Public interface EmployeeDao{
public Employee registerEmployee(Employee employee)throws EmployeeException;
// the above method take an Employee object without an empId and returned the
//registered Employee object having the autogenerated Id
public Employee getEmployeeById(int empId)throws EmployeeException;
public Employee deleteEmployeeById(int empId) throws EmployeeException;
public Employee updateEmployee(Employee employee)throws EmployeeException;
//the above method will return the updated Employee object, if we supply any Employee
object, which is not existing then it should throw the EmployeeException
}
Note:
● EmployeeException should be checked exception. And need to be thrown with a
proper message.
● Test all the above methods by creating separate Use-case classes
